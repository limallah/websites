<!-- QUESTION SIX -->
<!-- Browser can't read JSX because -->
Browsers cannot read JSX directly because it's a syntax extension to JavaScript that needs to be transpiled or compiled into plain JavaScript before it can be executed in the browser. JSX is commonly used with React, and a transpiler like Babel is used to convert the JSX code into plain JavaScript that can be understood by the browser. JSX provides a more readable and expressive way to write component templates compared to using plain JavaScript.
